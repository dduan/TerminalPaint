This project demonstrates how to build a TUI program in Swift with [Termbox][].
It's similar to a demo program included in the [original termbox][] project.

You'll need Swift Package Manager to build it:

1. clone this repo.
2. go to the folder and run `make`.
3. (press "q" to quit the program, read about it at bottom of your terminal).

For technical details, read `Sources/TerminalPaint/main.swift`
